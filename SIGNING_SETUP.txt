QUICK SETUP GUIDE - UW ASSIST Lab ScreenLife Release Build
================================================

Since you've run generate-keystore.bat, you should have entered:
1. Your name, organization, etc.
2. A keystore password (minimum 6 characters)
3. A key password (minimum 6 characters)

The keystore file should be at: app\release-keystore.jks

NEXT STEPS:
-----------

1. CREATE signing.properties FILE:
   
   Copy and paste this into a new file called "signing.properties":
   
   storeFile=release-keystore.jks
   storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_HERE
   keyAlias=release-key
   keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE
   
   Replace YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_HERE and YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE
   with the actual passwords you used.

2. BUILD THE RELEASE:
   
   Option A - Run the automated script:
   > setup-and-build.bat
   
   Option B - Run manually:
   > gradlew clean
   > gradlew bundleRelease

3. FIND YOUR AAB FILE:
   
   Location: app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab
   This is what you upload to Google Play Console.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

If "keystore not found":
- Check if file exists at: app\release-keystore.jks
- If you saved it elsewhere, copy it to app\ folder

If "wrong password":
- Make sure passwords in signing.properties match exactly
- No quotes needed around passwords
- Check for extra spaces

If build fails:
- Run: gradlew clean
- Try: gradlew assembleRelease (builds APK instead of AAB)
- Check error messages for missing dependencies
